# Installing, configuring, and using the monitoring dashboards
{: #monitor}

You can monitor the status of {{site.data.keyword.cnc_short}} by using IBM Cloud Private's monitoring dashboards. The monitoring dashboards use Grafana, Kibana, and Prometheus to display detailed, customizable information about your {{site.data.keyword.cnc_short}} instance.

For information about monitoring your {{site.data.keyword.BluOpenStackDed}} cluster, see [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/manage_metrics/monitoring_service.html ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/manage_metrics/monitoring_service.html){: new_window}.

Before using the dashboards, you must generate and install them as described in the following steps.

## Step 1: Download, extract, and render the dashboard templates
{: #render}

Perform the following steps to prepare the dashboard templates for installation.

1. Download the {{site.data.keyword.cnc_short}} image from Passport Advantage (PPA). The file is a zipped tar file with a name similar to `ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5.tar.gz`. The file includes the dashboard templates and a `bash` script to render the dashboards from the templates.

1. Uncompress and expand the tar file:
  ```bash
  mkdir ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5 && tar -xvzf ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5.tar.gz -C ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5
  ``` 
  {: pre}

1. Change to the `charts` directory in the extracted directory:
  ```bash
  cd ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5/charts
  ```
  {: pre}

1. Uncompress and expand the zipped tar file in the `charts` directory:
  ```bash
  tar -xvzf ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5.tgz
  ```
  {: pre}

1. Change to the `dashboard` directory. It includes templates for alerts, logging, and metrics, as well as a `bash` script to generate dashboards
from templates.
  ```
  $ cd ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod/dashboard
  
  $ tree
  .
  ├── alerts.json.tpl
  ├── external-process-logging.json.tpl
  ├── frontend-logging.json.tpl
  ├── metrics.json.tpl
  └── render-dashboards.sh

  0 directories, 5 files
  ```

1. Run the `render-dashboards.sh` script to render the templates. Options for the script include:
  
    - `-v`, `--version {chart_version}`: The chart version; for example, `1.0.5`.
    - `-h`, `--help`: Print command help and exit.
    - `-r`, `--release {release_name}`: The Helm release name.
    - `-n`, `--namespace {namespace}`: The namespace of the deployment. The default namespace is `default`.

  ```bash
  ./render-dashboards.sh -v 1.0.5 -r my-test-release -n default
  ```
  {: pre}

The dashboard JSON files are generated under `ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod-1.0.5/charts/ibm-watson-compare-comply-prod/dashboard`.

  ```
  $ tree
  .
  ├── alerts.json
  ├── alerts.json.tpl
  ├── external-process-logging.json
  ├── external-process-logging.json.tpl
  ├── frontend-logging.json
  ├── frontend-logging.json.tpl
  ├── metrics.json
  ├── metrics.json.tpl
  └── render-dashboards.sh

  0 directories, 9 files
  ```

## Step 2: Import the templates
{: #import-tpls}

After you render the dashboards, import one or more of them as described in the following sections:

  - [Importing the metrics dashboard](metrics.html#import)
  - [Importing the logging dashboards](logging.html#import)
  - [Importing the alerts dashboard](alerts.html#import)

## Step 3: View and customize dashboards
{: #use-dboards}

After you import your selected dashboards, view and customize them as described in the following sections:

  - [Viewing the metrics dashboard](metrics.html#view)
  - [Viewing the logging dashboards](logging.html#view)
  - [Adding alert rules](alerts.html#add)
