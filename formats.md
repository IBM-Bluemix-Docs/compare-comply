Observe the following notes regarding files submitted to {{site.data.keyword.cncshort}}.

  - Not all input formats are accepted by all methods. For more information, see [Support by method](#methods) and the lists of supported methods in the details of each input type described in the following sections.
  - For optimal results, specify the MIME type when submitting a file. For example, if you submit a PDF file, it is recommended that you specify the file as follows:
     ```
     curl -u "apikey:{apikey}" -F "file=@myFile.pdf;type=application/pdf" https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/compare-comply/api/v1/{method_name}?version=2018-10-15
     ```
     {: pre}
    MIME types are provided with the supported file types listed in the following sections.
  - Files can be up to 1.5 MB in size when submitted to the service with individual methods. If you submit files through the [`/v1/batches` interface](/docs/services/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-batching), files can be up to 50 MB in size.
  - Documents with non-standard page layouts (such as 2 or 3 columns per page) do not parse correctly.
  - The [{{site.data.keyword.cncshort}} Tooling](/docs/services/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-using_tool) accepts all file types other than text.

The service can process "plain" text (ASCII) files that use a monospaced font and page breaks. Richer text formats that include non-monospaced fonts and style attributes such as bold and italics are not yet supported. If you need to process an enriched text file, convert it to PDF before submitting it to the service.

The MIME type is `text/plain`.

{{site.data.keyword.cncshort}} methods that support text include the following.

  - `/v1/html_conversion`

## Support by method
{: #methods}

The service's methods can accept different types of files as specified in the following table.

| Method           |PDF support   |Word support     |Image support        |Text support    |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Tooling*           | Supported    | Supported | All supported image formats | **Not** supported |
|`/v1/html_conversion`| Supported | Supported | All supported image formats | Supported |
|`/v1/element_classification`| Supported | Supported | All supported image formats | **Not** supported |
|`/v1/tables`      | Supported | Supported | All supported image formats | Supported |
|`/v1/invoices`    | Supported | Supported | All supported image formats | **Not** supported |
|`/v1/comparison`* | Supported | Supported | All supported image formats | **Not** supported |

\* The Tooling and `/v1/comparison` method also accept JSON files from the output of the `/v1/element_classification` method.
{: note}

The `/v1/feedback` methods do not accept image or text files. 

The `/v1/batches` methods accept images and text files according to the method called in the batch job. For example, if your batch job calls the `/v1/html_conversion` method, it accepts both images and text files. Similarly, if your batch job calls the `/v1/element_classification` method, it accepts images but not text files.
