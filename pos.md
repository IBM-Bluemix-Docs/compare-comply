# Understanding purchase-order parsing
{: #pos}

You can analyze purchase orders by using the **Purchase order understanding** feature.
{: shortdesc}

**Purchase order understanding** is a beta feature. For information about beta features, see [Beta features](/docs/services/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-release_notes#beta_features) in the [Release notes](/docs/services/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-release_notes). You must request access to purchase-order parsing by completing the following [form](https://datasciencex.typeform.com/to/Fjyf6t).
{: important}

Because **Purchase order understanding** is a beta feature, it is not included in the service's SDKs or listed in the service's API Reference. You can call the method only by using its `curl` command as described in the following sections.
{: important}

You can parse and classify the contents of purchase orders in your [input document](/docs/services/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-formats) by calling the `POST /v1/purchase_orders` method. 

In a `bash` shell or equivalent environment such as Cygwin, use the `POST /v1/purchase_orders` method to classify a purchase order. The method takes the following input parameters:
  - `version` (**required** `string`): A date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` that identifies the specific version of the API to use when processing the request.
  - `file` (**required** `file`): The input file that is to be parsed for purchase-order information.

Replace `{apikey}` with the API key you copied earlier and `{input_file}` with the path to the input file to parse.

```bash
curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}" -F 'file=@{input_file}' https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/compare-comply/api/v1/purchase_orders?version=2018-10-15
```

The command output uses the following schema.
