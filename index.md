# About
{: #about}

IBM Watson&trade; Compare and Comply is a collection of advanced APIs that enable better and faster document understanding. The APIs are pre-trained to handle document conversion, table understanding, Natural Language Processing, and comparison for contracts. JSON output adds real power to end-user applications, for a wide variety of use cases. The machine learning feedback interface is available to collect your feedback which is then incorporated into regular improvements to the core NLP model; the more you use it, the better the system performs.

Compare and Comply is designed to provide:

  - Natural language understanding of contracts and invoices
  - The ability to convert programmatic or scanned PDF documents, Microsoft Word files, image files, and text files to annotated JSON or to HTML
  - Identification of legal entities and categories that align with subject matter expertise
  - The ability to extract table information from an input document
  - The ability to compare two contracts

Compare and Comply brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated Watson APIs to input a file to identify sections, lists (numbered and bulleted), footnotes, and tables, converting these items into a structured HTML format. Furthermore, classification of this structured format is annotated and output as JSON with labeled elements, types, categories, and other information.


## Beta features
{: #beta_features}

IBM will release services, features, and language support that are classified as beta or experimental. These capacities can be unstable, can change frequently, and can be discontinued with short notice. They are provided so you can evaluate their functionality. A beta or experimental capacity might not provide the same level of performance or compatibility that generally released capacities provide. These capacities are not designed for use in a production environment, and any such use is at your own risk.

To get started with the service, see the [Getting started](/docs/services/compare-comply/getting-started.html) page.
