# About
{: #about}

IBM Watson&trade; Compare and Comply enables understanding of governing business documents with pre-trained models so enterprises can get started in minutes. The document conversion (scanned PDFs, TIFFs, JPEG, Word) capabilities enable both machine-to-machine and machine-to-human readable formats. The table understanding, element classification and compare capabilities of Compare and Comply enable automation of complex business processes such as contract review and negotiation, invoice reconciliation, software entitlement verification, and more. Such automation of processes will result in increased productivity, minimization of costs, and reduced exposure.

Compare and Comply provides:

  - Natural language understanding of contracts and other governing documents
  - Conversion of scanned documents (PDF, tiff, jpg) and Word into HTML
  - Identification of parties in the contracts and the obligations and rights assigned to each
  - Automatic labeling of sentences in contracts with categories such as  termination, privacy, payment terms, and more
  - A Compare API that analyzes two contracts, side-by-side, and highlights similarities and differences at the level of individual clauses
  - Table extraction, which parses each cell in the table and associates metadata such as row and column headers
  - A feedback API and user interface that lets subject matter experts send corrections and suggestions to IBM data science teams for continuous improvements of models
