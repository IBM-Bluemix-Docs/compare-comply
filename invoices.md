# Understanding invoice parsing
{: #invoices}

You can analyze invoice documents by using the **Invoice understanding** feature.
{: shortdesc}

**Invoice understanding** is a beta feature. For information about beta features, see [Beta features](/docs/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-release_notes#beta_features) in the [Release notes](/docs/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-release_notes). You must request access to invoice parsing by completing the following [form](http://ibm.biz/invoices).
{: important}

Because **Invoice understanding** is a beta feature, iit is not included in the service's SDKs or listed in the service's API Reference. You can call the method only by using its `curl` command as described in the following sections.
{: important}

You can classify the contents of invoices in your [input document](/docs/compare-comply?topic=compare-comply-formats) by calling the `POST /v1/invoices` method. 

In a `bash` shell or equivalent environment such as Cygwin, use the `POST /v1/invoices` method to classify an invoice. The method takes the following input parameters:
  - `version` (**required** `string`): A date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` that identifies the specific version of the API to use when processing the request.
  - `file` (**required** `file`): The input file that is to be classified for invoice information.

Replace `{apikey}` with the API key you copied earlier, `{url}` with the URL you copied earlier, and `{input_file}` with the path to the input file to parse.

```bash
curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}" -F "file=@{input_file}" "{url}/v1/invoices?version=2018-10-15"
```
{: codeblock}

The command output uses the following schema.

The schema is arranged as follows.
