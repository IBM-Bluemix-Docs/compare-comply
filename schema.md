# Understanding the output schema
{: #output_schema}

After a document has been processed by the `/v1/element_classification` method, the service provides JSON output in the following schema.

The schema is arranged as follows. 

 - `document_text`: The full text of the parsed document in HTML format.
 - `document_title`: The title of the parsed document. If the service did not detect a title, the value of this element is `null`.
 - `model_id`: The analysis model to be used by the service. For the `/v1/element_classification` and `/v1/comparison` methods, the default is `contracts`. For the `/v1/tables` method, the default is `tables`. These defaults apply to the standalone methods as well as to the methods' use in batch-processing requests.
 - `model_version`: The version of the analysis model specified by the value of the `model_id` parameter.
 - `elements`: An array of the document elements detected by the service.
    - `sentence`: The location of the sentence as defined by its begin and end indexes.
    - `sentence_text`: The text of the sentence.
    - `types`: An array that describes what the element is and whom it affects. It consists of one or more sets of `nature` keys (the effect of the sentence on the identified `party`) and `party` keys (whom the sentence affects).
      - `label`: An array of `nature` and `party` elements.
        - `nature`: The type of action the sentence requires. Possible values are `Definition`, `Disclaimer`, `Exclusion`, `Obligation`, and `Right`.
        - `party`: A string identifying the party to whom the sentence applies.
      - `provenance`: Each object in the `types` and `categories` arrays includes a `provenance` object. The object has one or more `id` keys.
        - `id`: A hashed value that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.
    - `categories`: An array that lists the functional categories into which the sentence falls; in other words, the subject matter of the sentence.
      - `label`: The category into which the sentence falls. See [Categories at Understanding contract parsing](/docs/services/compare-comply/parsing.html#contract_categories) for a list of categories.
      - `provenance`: Each object in the `types` and `categories` arrays includes a `provenance` object that includes one or more `id` keys.
        - `id`: A hashed value that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.
    - `attributes`: An array of `type`, `text`, and `attribute` elements.
      - `type`: The type of attribute. Possible values are `Location`, `DateTime`, and `Currency`.
      - `text`: The text that is associated with the attribute.
      - `attribute`: The location of the attribute as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.

 - `effective_dates`: An array identifying the effective dates of the document.
   - `text`: The effective dates, listed as a string.
   - `location`: The location of the date or dates as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.
 - `contract_amounts`: An array identifying the monetary amounts identified in the document.
   - `text`: The contract amounts, listed as a string.
   - `location`: The location of the amount or amounts as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.

 - `parties`: An array defining the parties identified by the service.
   - `party`: A string value identifying the party.
   - `role`: A string value identifying the role of the party.
     - `addresses`: An array of objects that identify addresses.
        - `text`: A string containing the address.
        - `location`: The location of the address as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.
     - `contacts`: An array defining the name and role of contacts identified in the input document.
        - `name`: A string listing the name of an identified contact.
        - `role`: A string listing the role of the identified contact.
    
 - `document_structure`: A JSON object describing the structure of the input document.
    - `sections`: A JSON array containing one object per section or subsection detected in the input document. Sections and subsections are not nested; instead, they are flattened out and can be placed back in order by using the `begin` and `end` values of the element and the `level` value of the section. Each object in the `sections` array includes a list of zero or more `sentences` that are directly under the title of the detected section.
      - `title_text`: A string listing the section title, if detected.
      - `title`: A JSON object listing the `begin` and `end` values of the section title.
      - `level`: An integer indicating the level at which the section is located in the input document. For example, `1` represents a top-level section, `2` represents a subsection within the level `1` section, and so forth.
      - `sentences`: A JSON array containing objects that specify the `begin` and `end` values of the sentences in the section.
    - `leading_sentences`: A JSON array containing one object per section or subsection, in parallel with the `sections` array, that details the leading sentences in the matching section or subsection. As in the `sections` array, the objects are not nested; instead, they are flattened out and can be placed back in order by using the `begin` and `end` values of the element or any level markers in the input document.
      - `sentence_text`: The text of the section's leading sentence.
      - `sentence`: A JSON object indicating the `begin` and `end` values of the leading sentence's location in the input document.
      - `sentences`: A JSON array containing objects that specify the `begin` and `end` values of the sentences that follow the leading sentence.
    
 - `tables`: An array defining the tables identified by the service.
    - `table`: The location of the current table as defined by its `begin` and `end` offsets in the input document.
    - `table_text`: The textual contents of the current table from the input document without associated markup content.

**Note on tables:**
  - Row and column index values per cell are zero-based and so begin with `0`.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `row_header_ids` and `row_header_texts` elements indicate a hierarchy of row headers.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `column_header_ids` and `column_header_texts` elements indicate a hierarchy of column headers.
