## Labeling and deleting data in the Compare and Comply service
{: #delete-data}

The Compare and Comply service enables you to delete all data that is associated with feedback and batch-processing requests. To delete data, you must do the following:

1.  Use the `X-Watson-Metadata` header to associate a customer ID with data that is passed by a request to the service; see [Specifying a customer ID](#specify-customer-id).
1.  Use the `DELETE /v1/user_data` method to delete all data that is associated with a specified customer ID; see [Deleting data](#delete-cnc).

By default, no customer ID is associated with data.

Experimental and beta features are not intended for use with a production environment and therefore are not guaranteed to function as expected when labeling and deleting data. Experimental and beta features should not be used when implementing a solution that requires the labeling and deletion of data.
{: note}

### Specifying a customer ID
{: #specify-customer-id}

To associate a customer ID with data, include the `X-Watson-Metadata` header with the request that passes the information. You pass the string `customer_id={id}` as the argument of the header. The following example associates the customer ID `my_ID` with the data passed with a `POST /v1/feedback` request:

```bash
curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}"
--header "X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id=my_ID"
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--header "Accept: application/pdf"
--data "{feedback_data}"
"https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/compare-comply/api/v1/feedback?version=2018-10-15"
```
{: codeblock}

A customer ID can include any characters except for the `;` (semicolon) and `=` (equals sign). Specify a random or generic string for the customer ID; do not specify a personally identifiable string, such as an email address or Twitter ID. You can specify different customer IDs with different requests. A customer ID that you specify is associated with the instance of the service whose credentials are used with the request; only credentials for that instance of the service can delete data associated with the ID.

Use the `X-Watson-Metadata` header with the following methods:

  - `POST /v1/batches`
  - `POST /v1/feedback`
  - `GET /v1/feedback`
  - `GET /v1/feedback/{feedback_id}`

The customer ID is associated with data that is sent with the request.

### Deleting data
{: #delete-cnc}

To delete all data that is associated with a customer ID, use the `DELETE /v1/user_data` method. You pass the string `customer_id={id}` as a query parameter with the request. The following example deletes all data for the customer ID `my_ID`:

  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE -u "apikey:{apikey}" 
 https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/compare-comply/api/v1/user_data?customer_id=my_ID
  ```
  {: codeblock}

The `DELETE /v1/user_data` method deletes all data that is associated with the specified customer ID, regardless of the method by which the information was added. The method has no effect if no data is associated with the customer ID. You must issue the request with credentials for the same instance of the service that was used to associate the customer ID with the data.
